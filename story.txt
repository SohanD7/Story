One day there was a boy named Sohan. Sohan wanted to be a famous basketball player but he could never do well and was always picked last by the other boys.
One day, LeBron James held a camp in Sohan's neighborhood. Then, he chose Sohan to come to the NBA with him to check out how it works.
He chose Sohan because Sohan showed passion, which nobody showed. Sohan then got ready for the trip to LA but was nervous.
